  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Gompertz differential equation
\[
\frac{\dx}{\dt}=h(t)\ln\left({\frac{k}{x(t)}}\right)x(t)
\]
 \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Gompertz: $h(t)=\alpha=const.$  
    \end{itemize}
\item
Possible solution
\[
x(t)=k \e^{\left(-{a_0} \e^{\left(-\int{h(t) \dt}\right)}\right)}
\]
   
  \item
   Choosing
\[
h(t)=a_1 \e^{\left(-a_2 t\right)}
\]
  \item
   leads to
\[
x(t)=k \e^{\left(-{a_0}\e^{\left(\frac{a_1}{a_2} \e^{\left({-a_2 t}\right)}\right)}\right)}
\]

  \end{itemize}
