Obacht / Caution:

The following predictions are based on a simple model.
This model cannot predict future changes in behaviour of the investigated group.

The calculated curve is based on the cumulative Covid-19 cases reported and the population size.
That means, if a change in behaviour causes a delayed decrease in the infection rate, this decrease is even more delayed in the outcome of the model.
The mean value of the inflection point is used for stabilization, causing some additional delay.

The previous slide's prediction is restricted to two days. The following slides extended the prediction to 360 days, so that the peak (maximum) is included in the graphs.
The absolute values depicted on the y-axis are a prediction based on the assumption that the behaviour of the investigated group remains exactly the same in the future as it was in the past.
