A logistic growth function is adjusted to the reported number of infections in Greece


Each frame represents a single day showing the reported numbers so far and a prediction for the next two days


The more reports are available the more reliable becomes the prediction


Numbering of the x-axis:
  - Situation-Report #1 published on Jan 21 lists the numbers for Jan 20 -> day 0
  - Situation-Report #2 published on Jan 22 lists the numbers for Jan 21 -> day 1
  - Situation-Report #2 published on Jan 23 lists the numbers for Jan 22 -> day 2
