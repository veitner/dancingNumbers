Rate of infections per day - Number of reported new infections and the derivative of the model

The time of the maximum is the turning point (inflection point) - from that time there will be fewer new infections per day

It is assumed that the number of deaths is somehow delay-related to the number of new infections. The death rate is estimated by applying a convolution.

Convolution:
h(t)/q = (f*g)(t-d)
q: mortality rate (free parameter)
f=f(s,d): gaussian probability function
g: derivative of logistic growth function
t: time
d: delay (free parameter)
s=p*d: sigma (p: free parameter)


The numbers dance until the behavior of the investigated cluster is stable or until the virus becomes extinct
