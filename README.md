- The program is written in __Java__ using some routines from ___Numerical Recipes___. Due to license restrictions these files are not included. 
You will either need to buy these files (see subfolder `com/nr/info.txt`) or read one of the books to key them in manually.

- The main program is within `Frames.java`.

- To generate a mpeg-Video you will need **[ffmpeg](<https://ffmpeg.org/>)** and a bash shell to run the script `create2` in subfolder `mov`

PS:\
A similar approach can be viewed at <https://publichealth.gsu.edu/research/coronavirus/>.

And there is a preprint of a paper describing the fit of the Richardson-Equation online available <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05681.pdf>.
