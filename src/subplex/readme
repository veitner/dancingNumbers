this could be a replacement for amoeba

the original code is in fortran but i do not want to link a platform dependent library, therefor i started to translate from fortran to java first,
then i thought it could be easier to translate from c to java ...

anyway, this is not finished yet - the replaced goto jumps and pointer arithmetic needs to be checked
