Due to license restrictions following files are not part of this repo:

NRUtil.java
RealValueFun.java
min/Amoeba.java

But a diff file for Amoeba.java is included (Amoeba.java.diff), because it was modified to retrieve some intermediate results and to contract around the best solution found so far in case the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.

You either need to buy the source code from "http://www.numerical.recipes/" or one of the books and key in the code

Or you replace "Amoeba" by some other minimization routine (e.g. Levenberg-Marquardt)
