Due to license restrictions following files are not part of this repo:

NRUtil.java
RealValueFun.java
min/Amoeba.java

But a diff file for Amoeba.java is included (Amoeba.java.diff), because it was extended to respect some constraints in function amotry.

You either need to buy the source code from "http://www.numerical.recipes/" or one of the books and key in the code

Or you replace "Amoeba" by some other minimization routine (e.g. Levenberg-Marquardt)
