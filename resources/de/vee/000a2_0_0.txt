Parameter stability


Each parameter should converge towards a constant,
i.e. the relative change should become small


The more consistent the behavior of the investigated cluster (e.g. country) the more reliable the prediction


If the behavior of the investigated cluster changes suddenly (e.g. closure of schools, social distancing), the numbers start dancing again, and it takes some time until the graph stabilizes again
